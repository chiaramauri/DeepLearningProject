# DeepLearningProject

The content of this repository is the following:

Preprocessing_data.ipynb contains the preprocessing of the data, the splitting of the data set in training, validation and test set and the FastText embedding.

Logistic_regression.ipynb performs logistic regression on the data.

FFNN.ipynb, RNN_onhot.ipynb and RNN_fasttext.ipynb are notebooks with the implementation of the FFNN with bag of words model, of the RNN with one-hot encoding of words and of the RNN with FastText embedding, respectively.

Data_matrix_sample_programs2.pickle is the original data set.

Reproduce_results.zip is a zipped folder, which contains 6 notebooks reproducing the main results of the project. The notebooks are:

Reproduce_FFNN_0layers.ipynb which reproduces the results of the FFNN with no hidden layers, on the balanced dataset

Reproduce_FFNN_1layer.ipynb which reproduces the results of the FFNN with one hidden layer, on the balanced dataset

Reproduce_FFNN_1layer-unbalanced_dataset.ipynb which reproduces the results of the FFNN with one hidden layer, on the unbalanced dataset

Reproduce_FFNN_2layers.ipynb which reproduces the results of the FFNN with 2 hidden layers, on the balanced dataset

Reproduce_RNN_one-hot.ipynb which reproduces the results of the RNN with one-hot encoding of words, on the balanced dataset

Reproduce_RNN_fasttext.ipynb which reproduces the results of the RNN with FastText embedding, on the balanced dataset
