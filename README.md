Claim detection for fact checking, Chiara Mauri

Reproduce results is a zipped folder, which contains notebooks reproducing the main results of the project.

Preprocessing_data contains the preprossing of the datam the splitting in training, validation and test set and the FastText embedding.
Logistic_regression. performs logistic regression on the data.
FFNN.ipy, RNN_on-hot and RNN_fasttext are notebooks with the implementation of the FFNN with bag of words model, the RNN with one-hot encofing of words and the RNN with FastText embedding, respectively.
Data_matrix_sample_programs2.pickle is the original
